# Real-Time Face and Smile Detection Using OpenCV
## This project implements a real-time face and smile detection system using OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifiers. The application processes video from your webcam and highlights detected faces and smiles with bounding boxes and labels.

### Features:
* Real-time face detection: Detects faces in the video feed and highlights them with blue bounding boxes.
* Smile detection: Identifies smiles within the detected faces and marks them with green bounding boxes.
* Live annotations: Displays labels for faces and smiles in the video.
* Easy exit: Press q to exit the application.
